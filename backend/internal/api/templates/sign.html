        Please take a moment to consider your place in life. Hear the geese in
        the distance and the little birds as the year turns once again. Gaze a
        moment at the soft, soggy light, the transient brightening at the start
        of even a dull day. Sense the frabric of clothes on your skin, on their
        journey from new to tatters. The half aches of this day yet to express
        themselves. Regrets, vaunts--cup them in your hand and place them in a
        nook among the roots of the river bank, broken bits of nothing for the
        rain to find. Sigh. Then, when you're quite ready, sign in.
