## Overview

PENUMBRA (Planning & Execution Nexus for Urgent Management, Briefing & Recording App) is a new web application for caseworkers to manage their tasks. Use of PENUMBRA is not mandatory, but may become so for any caseworker who elects not to use it.

## Project status

This project should be considered inclomplete if any `todo` remains in the actual code. Any CI/Cd pipeline should enforce that.
